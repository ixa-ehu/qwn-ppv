* TODO list:
- Improve Lexicon loading function to be more error tolerant
- Evaluator is based on single words --> include ngram lexicon look up 
- Lexicon representation: Lexicon objects at the moment only store either lemma or sense information. 
                          Update lexicons so they may be able to store both lemma and sense informations at the same time.
			  More memory consumption VS. richer representation + possibity to integrate lemma/sense evaluations in a single object.
- Evaluation mode optimization:
  - Batch mode in order to: 
	- Evaluate several lexicons over a single corpus on the same execution.
 	- Evaluate several corpora over a single lexicon on the same execution.
- More complex evaluators (other than average ratio and Mohammad's) 
- Format integration: 
  - lmf/xml lexicons 
  - xml (naf?) based corpora?
- ...
